Neuroanatomy Basics:

1. **Neuron**: The basic building block of the nervous system, responsible for transmitting electrical and chemical signals.

2. **Synapse**: The gap between two neurons where communication occurs through neurotransmitters.

3. **Neurotransmitter**: Chemicals that transmit signals across a synapse from one neuron to another.

4. **Cerebrum**: The largest part of the brain, responsible for higher functions like thought, memory, and voluntary movement.

5. **Cerebellum**: The part of the brain that controls balance, coordination, and fine motor skills.

6. **Brainstem**: The lower part of the brain that connects to the spinal cord and controls basic functions like heart rate and breathing.

7. **Hippocampus**: A brain region involved in learning and memory.

8. **Amygdala**: A part of the brain involved in emotion regulation, especially fear and pleasure.

9. **Spinal Cord**: A long, cylindrical structure that connects the brain to the peripheral nervous system and transmits signals.

10. **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**: The part of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord, including sensory and motor neurons.

11. **Central Nervous System (CNS)**: Consists of the brain and spinal cord; processes and coordinates all nervous system activity.

12. **Glial Cells**: Supportive cells in the nervous system that provide insulation, nutrients, and structural support for neurons.

13. **Myelin Sheath**: A fatty layer that surrounds the axon of a neuron to speed up signal transmission.

14. **Axon**: A long projection of a neuron that carries electrical impulses away from the cell body.

15. **Dendrites**: Branch-like structures on neurons that receive signals from other neurons.

16. **Limbic System**: A set of brain structures involved in emotions, memories, and arousal (stimulation).

17. **Thalamus**: The brain's relay station, directing sensory and motor signals to the appropriate areas of the brain.

18. **Hypothalamus**: A small region of the brain that regulates homeostasis, including temperature, hunger, and hormonal activity.

19. **Cortex**: The outer layer of the cerebrum, involved in complex functions like perception, thought, and decision-making.

20. **Basal Ganglia**: A group of structures that regulate movement and coordination.

21. **Corpus Callosum**: A thick band of nerve fibers that connects the two hemispheres of the brain, allowing communication between them.

22. **Frontal Lobe**: The part of the brain involved in decision-making, problem-solving, and voluntary movements.

23. **Parietal Lobe**: Processes sensory information such as touch, temperature, and pain.

24. **Temporal Lobe**: Involved in processing auditory information and memory.

25. **Occipital Lobe**: The part of the brain responsible for visual processing.

26. **Medulla Oblongata**: Part of the brainstem that controls vital functions like heartbeat and breathing.

27. **Pons**: A structure in the brainstem that links the medulla oblongata and the thalamus, playing a role in sleep and respiration.

28. **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)**: A clear fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.

29. **Meninges**: Protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.

30. **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)**: A protective barrier that prevents harmful substances in the blood from entering the brain.

31. **Somatic Nervous System**: The part of the PNS that controls voluntary movements and sensory reception.

32. **Autonomic Nervous System**: The part of the PNS that controls involuntary functions like heartbeat and digestion.

33. **Sympathetic Nervous System**: Part of the autonomic system that activates the "fight or flight" response.

34. **Parasympathetic Nervous System**: Part of the autonomic system that promotes "rest and digest" activities.

35. **Action Potential**: The electrical signal that travels along a neuron to transmit information.

36. **Resting Potential**: The electrical charge of a neuron when it is not transmitting a signal.

37. **Plasticity**: The brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experience or injury.
